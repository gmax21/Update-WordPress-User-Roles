Remember to remove the plugin onces you're done, else it runs constantly!!! 

There are no checkes for super admin roles, no settings, nothing fancy. You just install, activate and visit the site, if in a network/mutisite you would load all sites. This was simple a quick solution to a members problem in 2014 on WPMU DEV (link above)
